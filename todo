parameters :
- gps coords
- bike type / park
- min rate
- max last rate
- max dist

process :
create object from parameters
while 0 suitableBikes.length :
  fetch stations + order by gps dist
  filter stations - operative status
  filter stations - not already fetched 
  filter stations - available bikes/park
  for each station :
    get station walking distance
    if : station dist < max dist
      get station bikes
      filter station bikes w/ parameters in suitableBikes
    else 
      ignore
      reachedMaxDistFlag = true

top bike : 
best rating
last rate < max
closest to starting point
with most bikes in parameters available (if +/- 2min walk distance)

top park : 
closest to starting point
with most spots available (consider overflow)
